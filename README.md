# Raytracing-in-a-Weekend-GLSL
Implementing the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley in GLSL using fragment shaders.

I used a software called [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed/tree/460717edf74dcb85111b1702f64b59d304e6ac08) by dfransx to debug and render the GLSL shaders into images, it's a great tool to debug glsl/hlsl shaders like we do with normal code and render to Quad primitives and has many other powerful features.

(_The following code can also be run in ShaderToy by just changing some the uniform variables_)

The fragment shader goes through every pixel and renders the images. I have arranged them into different shaders and output images as per each chapter.

### Chapter 2 : Output an Image
